Federated Learning
=============================
âš›

One potential solution to enable for secure and private data analysis is Federated Learning~\cite{kairouz2019advances,mcmahan2017communication,yang2019federated}. Federated Learning has emerged as a standard computational paradigm for distributed machine and deep learning that allows geographically distributed data sources to efficiently train machine learning models while their raw data remain at their original location. This contradicts the traditional machine learning algorithms that require all training data to be aggregated at a centralized location. This data aggregation step introduces a huge security and privacy threat and can violate the regulations enforced by the data regulatory frameworks. Alternatively, Federated Learning relaxes the need for raw data migration and instead pushes the training of the machine learning model down to each source. During federated training, only the locally trained model parameters are shared with a centralized entity that is responsible for aggregating these parameters to compute the federated model. Figure~\ref{fig:RepresentativeLearningEnvironments} shows how a representative centralized and federated learning environment and how both environments differ in regard to data (centralized) and model (federated) sharing.
