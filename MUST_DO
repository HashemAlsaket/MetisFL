TODO: 
- Figure out how/when/where to generate any fhe related keys/files and how to share them with those that must know them. The resources folder needs to go.

- Prefer to use abs paths thought the code. 

- The content (py + .so) of the project root will be place under the 'site-packages' dir of the user's python env. We should only put code there. If there is any config file that must be read at runtime that should be static and public. Any user related data that the code needs to know or generates must be stored outside this project root. E.g., somewhere like /home/user/.metisfl
