NOTES

1. When defining a cluster, all the servers(parameter & worker) must start from index 0 (task_id = 0,1,2 etc...), otherwise it crashes


2. The Tensorflow DATA API is CPU intensive so a parameter server must exist in the TFHost


3. StopAtStepHook indicates at which step model's training phase must stop. Step in tensorflow terminology refers to model's gradients updates. That is,
if we want to run 10 batches, then the global step of the model will be equal to 10. (1 step == 1 batch)


4. If the machine where the network training request client runs is inside the secure network of all the machines (e.g. VPN),
and there is a machine that can connect with the client due to not being part of the network, then there is a chance that
packages (e.g. variables updates) are not being delivered to the client.
