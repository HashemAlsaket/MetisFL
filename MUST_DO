TODO: 
- Figure out how/when/where to generate any fhe related keys/files and how to share them with those that must know them. The resources folder needs to go.

- Prefer to use abs paths thought the code. 

- The content (py + .so) of the project root will be place under the 'site-packages' dir of the user's python env. We should only put code there. If there is any config file that must be read at runtime that should be static and public. Any user related data that the code needs to know or generates must be stored outside this project root. E.g., somewhere like /home/user/.metisfl 

- python 3.11 does not work. Pybind wont compile. Perhaps upgrade to newer version.

FIXME: (pkyriakis)
- The wheel for some reason packages the proto/*.h files instead of the py files. 

NOTE: (dstripelis)
- I removed all lines from .bazelrc except  "--action_env=BAZEL_CXXOPTS=-std=c++17" build was just fine. Check if we actually need them.

- Py pkg does not include some py files; those under proto/ and the controller/__main__.py

- Not clear which python version is used for each .so that's being built 

```
ImportError: /home/panoskyriakis/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/metisfl/controller/controller.so: undefined symbol: _ZNSt10filesystem12current_pathB5cxx11Ev
```
Apparently the palisades so are not linked statically into the controller.so or the fhe.so and 

If you cannot immediately regenerate your protos, some other possible workarounds are:
 1. Downgrade the protobuf package to 3.20.x or lower.
 2. Set PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python (but this will use pure-Python parsing and will be much slower).
